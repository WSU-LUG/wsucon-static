==========

This is the old static [LUG WSUCon website](http://wsucon.wsu.edu) project.  It ought (needs) to be upgraded to a [deployable project](https://github.com/andrewbates09/wsucon) in the near future.


## Summary

This was originally just a weekend project to provide a new website for the event.  Currently, the website is updated manually and new pages are added as needed.

### Plan

* Keep updating as needed for now
* Finish new project
* Replace & maintain
